The Graph Editor [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/flowhub/the-graph.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/flowhub/the-graph) [![MIT license](http://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-brightgreen.svg)](#license)
================

This project provides a set [React](https://facebook.github.io/react) components for viewing and editing node-based graphs.
The focus is on graphs used for dataflow and [Flow-based programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming).

The graph structure is stored by [fbp-graph](https://github.com/flowbased/fbp-graph), which supports extendable metadata and undo/redo.

You can optionally use [klayjs-noflo](https://github.com/noflo/klayjs-noflo) for automatic layout of graphs.

`the-graph` is used as the editor in the [Flowhub IDE](https://flowhub.io).
